# tic-tac-toe
This is my another Free Code Camp excercise

I tried to implement the Minimax algorithm, but had to give up because my programming skills are not high enough yet :(
Moreover, to do so would have to rewrite most of my code from scratch.
However - as far as I can tell - my if-else algorithm is just as good as the minimax but it's a lot quicker than MM, so it will do for now.
In addition, with my solution, it is possible to easily set 3 levels of difficulty
